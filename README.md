# signal
Signal Monitor System

For this proyect i wanted to simulate a remote distributed system. CORBA was used as the remote object interface framework. Then i used PHP as a server side script that would send the signals to an AJAX enabled web site. To test this project you would need to a web server (i recommend Apache) and a CORBA server as well. The frontend is web site that resides within the folder Modulo_Html_Ajax.
